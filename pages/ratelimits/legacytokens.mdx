## Legacy Tokens

<Callout type="warning">Legacy Tokens will stop working in July, 2026. Please login and generate a new one.</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">If you pay for premium and are using a legacy token you will need to use a newly generated token to access the perks.</Callout>

---
All legacy tokens, irrespective of premium status have a global ratelimit of 30 requests over 60 seconds (1 request every 2 seconds).

If a ratelimit for a route is higher than this, your ratelimit will still be 30/30s.<br/>
If it is lower, the lower ratelimit will be enforced.

Find the current ratelimits [here](/ratelimits/tokens)

### How our ratelimits work

Some Random API uses a sliding window ratelimit.
